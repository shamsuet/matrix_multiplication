# matrix_multiplication
Matrix multiplication is a very important operation in many fields of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence and machine learning. In ML and many other fields, multiplying large matrices is heavily used. 

The bruteforce algorithm for matrix multiplication has a time complexity of O(n^3), and researchers have always been trying to come up with better, faster algorithms. Straussen's algorithm is the result of such efforts, which has a time complexity of O(n^lg7) = O(n^2.8). Therefore, Strassen's algorithm performs runs much faster when multiplying large matrices.

Here we develop code for the bruteforce algorithms as well as Strassen's algorithm that multiplies two square matrices.
